City Simulator in JavaFX

## About
A JavaFX front end for the MicropolisJ engine. A city simulator based on SimCity 1.

## Status
I started with the MicropolisJ engine and attempted to re-write/reimagine the 
UI in JavaFX.  While I made good progress over a few days with a UI I was happy
with, integrating the engine was an uphill battle.  I have way more to study
rgarding the engine and how it works.  Lot's of, "I wouldn't have done it that
way." engergy.  So I've checked this code in AS-IS. Nothing really works but the
adveturish may poke at this if they like.  I'm going back to work on one of my
other open source projects like ChibaCityBlues or Javamancer in order to retain my
sanity. (2024/11/24)
